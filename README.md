# Malware Detection and Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting and analyzing malware using machine learning techniques, specifically K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest classifiers. The goal is to accurately classify software as malicious or non-malicious based on various features.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about software samples, labeled as either malicious or non-malicious. 
- Total samples: 369
  - Malicious: 301
  - Non-malicious: 68

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
1. Handling null values
2. Selecting dependent and independent variables
3. Analyzing target attribute distribution

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution graphs (histograms/bar graphs) of column data
- Correlation matrix analysis
- Scatter and density plots

### Data Preparation
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets
- Feature scaling (used for gradient descent and distance-driven algorithms like KNN and SVM)

### Model Development
1. **Random Forest Classifier**
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier**

## Results

### Random Forest Classifier
- Confusion Matrix:
[[89 1]

macro avg 0.97 0.97 0.97 111
weighted avg 0.98 0.98 0.98 111

- Accuracy: 98.20%

## Key Findings
- Both Random Forest and KNN models show excellent performance in malware detection.
- Random Forest slightly outperforms KNN, achieving near-perfect accuracy (99.10%).
- Both models demonstrate high precision and recall for both malicious and non-malicious samples.
- The dataset is imbalanced, with significantly more malicious samples than non-malicious ones.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization

## How to Use
Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script

## Future Work
- Explore other machine learning algorithms for comparison
- Implement feature importance analysis to identify key indicators of malware
- Address the class imbalance issue using techniques like SMOTE or class weighting
- Develop a real-time malware detection system based on these models



This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques in cybersecurity, specifically for malware detection. The high accuracy of both models showcases the potential of these techniques in enhancing digital security measures.
